I plan to create a side-scrolling shooter/racing game with simple object avoidance and minor enemy attacking.  Ideally, this game will allow the player to avoid collisions by flying up or down along the left side of the screen.  Upon reaching the end of the "race" there will be a boss battle that consists of a splash screen with targets that pop up and must be clicked or "shot" within a short period to defeat the enemy.  Ideally, the game will detect the mouseover and redraw a cross-hair underneath. As for the "ear popping name," I am tentatively considering "Flight and Fight," but could certainly adopt a better name if I can come up with one.  Perhaps a gang leader stole your girlfriend and you jump on your bike and chase after him.  He rides along the right side of the screen dropping bombs for you to avoid.  Perhaps some obstacles could be shot.  After catching up or winning the race, the gamer engages in a shootout or fist fight by clicking targets as they appear. Perhaps survive 30 seconds of racing and hit 10 targets and you win.  Possible developer "cheats" could include immunity to projectiles or infinite ammo.
