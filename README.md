Includes the planning for the Game project

I am planning a side-scrolling action shooter called "Flight and Fight."  The motivating story for this game is a gang leader abducts the girlfriend of the gamer, who then must chase after him, catch him, and defeat him to save his girl.  The mechanics will consist of a racing portion where the gamer controls a bike that can move vertically along the left side of the screen.  The enemy biker will be on the right side of the screen dropping bombs or other obstacles for the gamer to avoid or potentially shoot.  After roughly 30 seconds of racing, a boss fight will take place where the gamer must click targets on a splash screen within a short amount of time.  Perhaps "shooting" 10 targets defeats the enemy and saves the day.  Ideally I would like to have the game detect the location of the mouse during this level and redraw a crosshair underneath it.
